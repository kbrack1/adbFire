<u><b>adbFire v1.14</b></u> is a companion program for Android Kodi and its forks. It also has many special features for the AFTV. <p>adbFire allows you to
install (sideload) Kodi and other apps to your Android device without the bother of installing the Android SDK. <p>
Additionally, it allows you to mount USB drives (when rooted) copy files to and from Kodi, backup and restore Kodi's data, root the AFTV (51.1.1.0 or earlier) and much more. <p>
<p>
For Windows XP and up, the <b><u>adbFire</b></u> folder can be located wherever you wish.<p>
Under OS X, adbFire.app may also be located wherever you wish. <p>
