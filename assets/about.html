<b><u>adbFire Overview</b></u>
<p>
<u><b>adbFire</b></u> is a companion program for Amazon Fire TV & Android Kodi and its forks. <p><b>adbFire</b> allows you to
install (sideload) apps to your Android device without the bother of installing the Android SDK. <p>
Additionally, it allows you copy files to and from your device, backup and restore Kodi's data, and more. <p>
<p>



The upper left Current Device combobox contains the names of your Android devices.
This dropdown combobox is empty when you first run adbFire. Once you add
devices, you choose a device from this menu in order to interact with it. 
This combobox is empty when you first start <b>adbFire</b>. It fills as you add device records.
<p>
The buttons associated with the device dropdown menu are:<p>
<b>Edit:</b>  Edit the selected device.<br>
<p>
<b>New:</b>   Display a blank device data entry screen (New USB devices are also added
via a double-click in the Connected Devices listbox, see below).<br>

<p>
<b>Disconnect:</b>  Disconnect the selected device.<br>


<p>
The Connect and Disconnect buttons are disabled if the selected
device is connected via USB.
<p>
Connections are attempted automatically for most adbFire
functions. For example, should the Backup button be pressed
and the selected device uses IP for a connection, adbFire
will make the connection without a button press.
<p>
The <b>Connected Devices</b> listbox shows all current adb connections.<p>
The </b>Status</b> listbox shows the device status (device/emulator/offline,etc).<br>
<p>
Double-clicking a USB device ID in the Connected Devices listbox opens
a new device record with the ID filled in. This allows you to easily
create a device record for USB connections

The <b>Restart ADB</b> button: Does refresh of connected devices
<p>
The <b>Stop ADB button</b> stops the ADB server.<br>
