<b><u>Install AFTV firmware</b></u><br>
Install firmware to  AFTV. Upgrade (or downgrade) your AFTV firmware. This works for firmware on a mounted USB drive/stick and for firmware on your PC.<p>When updating firmware from USB storage, adbFire looks on all devices for files with an extension of ".bin" or ".zip" and presents them for your choice.<p>
Installing firmware from a usb stick/drive is nearly twice as fast as installing a firmware file located on your PC or LAN.<p>
<p>
Please note that installation of firmware via Amazon's Native Recovery (this method) has been effectively obsoleted with the availibility of ClockworkMod, compiled for the Fire TV by rbox@xda.
<p>
<p>
IMPORTANT:  Do not attempt to install custom Clockwork Mod firmware via Amazon Native Recovery. It will not work!
<p>
<b>Root is REQUIRED</b>
