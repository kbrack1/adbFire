<b><u>Multiple Devices</b></u><br>
adbFire has the capability to manage up to ten Fire TV devices. Simply select one of the combobox items (1-10) and then click The Setup Device button to
define the preferences for that device. <p>
Each device has individual preferences, including media software installed, video cache settings, storage location for
pulled files & screenshots, ssh password (if rooted) and more.
