<b>Llama</b> is an app that tells a device to perform tasks when certain conditions are met. It's very handy in controlling the AFTV. The <b>"Llama Options"</b> button opens a dialog that offers different Llama related events:<p>
The <b>"Install Llama"</b> Click this checkbox to install Llama.<p>
<p>
<b>1. Boot the AFTV to Kodi</b><br>
Starts Kodi when the AFTV boots.
<p>
<b>2. Link Kodi to ikono TV</b><br>
It's very irritating to have to drill down seven or eight steps to start sideloaded apps on the AFTV. If you install the app "ikono TV" from the Amazon Store, Llama can hijack it, so when you press the ikono icon, Kodi starts. This way you have Kodi on the "Recent" and "Apps" menu of the AFTV. You may see the ikono TV app flash briefly before Kodi starts.
<p>
<b>3. Both</b><br>
Kodi starts when the AFTV boots AND is linked to the ikono TV app.<p>
<p>
<b>4. No action</b><br>
Do not adjust Llama settings.
<p>

The next four options relate to the ikono TV icon.<p>
<b>
1. Replace ikono TV icon with Kodi icon<br>
2. Replace ikono TV icon with Kodi icon<br>
3. Restore default ikono TV icon<br>
4. No action (the default)
</b>
<p>
<b><u>Note:</u></b> 1. After installing Llama and selecting an event, you must run Llama and select "import event from USB".  The events that adbFire installs start Kodi/XBMC. They will need to be edited to start variants like SPMC.
