<b><u>Install Recovery</b></u><br>
Upgrade your AFTV recovery partition to ClockworkMod or return it to stock recovery.
<p>
The recovery partition on your Fire TV is a subsystem where system upgrades and other operations are performed. In effect, it's a "mini" operating system on your Fire TV. <p>
As shipped by Amazon, the recovery partition is fairly useless; it allows the Fire TV to upgrade with offical Amazon images only.
Thanks to rbox@xda we have a version of Koush's ClockworkMod Recovery, specially compiled for the Fire TV!<p>
Clockwork Mod allows us to install custom pre-rooted images, backup our Fire TVs and more. 
<p>
After clicking "Install Recovery" from the menu, select the image you wish to install, fire-cwm for Clockwork Mod or recovery-stock to restore Amazon's stock image.
<p>
To obtain updated recovery images click the CWM link below or the rbox link on the "Credits" adbFire menu item. You will be taken to rbox's CWM topic on xda where you
will find image links. <p>
Drop updated images into your "recovery" folder. For OS X users, right-click on adbFire.app and select "Show Package Contents" to browse to your recovery folder.
<p>
IMPORTANT:  Do not attempt to install stock Amazon firmware via Clockwork Mod. It will not work!
<p>
<b>Root is REQUIRED</b>
