The <b>"Restore Kodi"</b> button restores a backed up copy of org.xbmc.* (or fork) to the device. Kodi must be closed in order to  restore.
<p>
Please note that adbFire will not restore backups created by other programs or addons.
<p>
Currently, when restoring backup sets nothing is moved to extUsb. If desired you will need to  <a href="mvdata.html">redo</a> the move via adbFire. A future release is planned that will perform data/thumbnail moves as part of the restore if desired.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
