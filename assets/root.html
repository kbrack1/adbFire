<u><b>"Root AFTV" </b> </u>
The <b>"Root AFTV"</b> button installs Chainfire Superuser and GeoHot's towelroot v 3.0. You must complete the process by running the towelroot app. Unfortunately, firmware 51.1.3.0 and above can't be rooted at this time. Check your Fire TV Settings/About to see your firmware ID.<p>
