<b><u>Console</b></u><br>
The File->Console menu selection opens up a terminal where you can issue adb commands from the command-line or
perform other command-line tasks.<p>
This terminal session adds the adb command to your path, so it is available in any location on your PC.
<p>
adbFire's adb is added to your path for the current console session only.
<p>

Wiindows users: If you're using the command-line to interact with a device via USB, Google's WinUSB device driver must be
installed. This driver is included with adbFire in the "winusb" folder and has been tested with Windows versions XP through 10. Directions for
installation can be seen at jocala.com; the link is below this help doc, or see the Video Help WinUSB video.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
