<b><u>Console</b></u><br>
The File->Console menu selection opens up a terminal where you can issue adb commands from the command-line or
perform other command-line tasks.<p>
For Windows, this terminal session adds adb.exe to your path, so it is available in any location on your PC. For
for OS X and Linux, issue the command <i>'source cpath'</i> to add adb to your path.
<p>
If you don't use the 'source cpath' command you'll need
to prefix the adb command with adb's path  './', e.g. './adb devices'.  By design, Unix-based systems don't look in the current directory for executables.
<p>
adbFire's adb is added to your path for the current console session only.  For OS X/Linux the 'source cpath' command needs to be repeated whenever you open a console from adbFire, should you wish to use the adb command-line anywhare on your system.
<p>

If you're using the command-line to connect Windows to the Stick via USB, Google's WinUSB device driver must be
installed. This driver is included with adbFire in the "winusb" folder. Directions for
installation can be seen at jocala.com; the link is below this help doc, or see the Video Help WinUSB video.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
