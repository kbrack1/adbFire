<b><u>adbFire Startup</b></u><br>
At startup  "ADB running" is displayed the status bar. If it's not, click "Start" in the ADB server group.
<p>
Enter the Android device IP or name into the text box (e.g. 192.168.1.110, or mydevice, if you have assigned your device a name). This address is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.<p>
<p>
Click "Connect". You should see "Device connected" on the status bar. If you don't, double-check your entry in the text box. When you establish a successful connection, <b><u>adbFire</b></u> will remember it for your next session.

<p><b>If you're unable
 to start the ADB server and connect to your Android device, this program will be non-functional. Please contact the author, jocala@jocala.com so your problem can be fixed!

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
