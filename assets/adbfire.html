<u><b>adbFire</b></u> is a companion program for Android XBMC, (13.X Gotham and later only). It allows you to
install XBMC and other apps to your Android device without the hassle of downloading the Android SDK. <p>

Additionally, it allows you to copy files to and from XBMC, backup and restore XBMC's data, root the Amazon Fire TV (51.1.1.0 or earlier) and more. <p>
<b><u>adbFire</u></b> has been successfully tested on Samsung cell phones and tablets and the Amazon Fire TV.<p>

At startup  "ADB running" is displayed the status bar. If it's not, click "Start" in the ADB server group.
<p>
Enter the Android device IP or name into the text box (e.g. 192.168.1.110, or mydevice, if you have assigned your device a name). This address is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.<p>
<p>
Click "Connect". You should see "Device connected" on the status bar. If you don't, double-check your entry in the text box. When you establish a successful connection, <b><u>adbFire</b></u> will remember it for your next session.

<p><b>If you're unable
 to start the ADB server and connect to your Android device, this program will be non-functional. Please contact the author, jocala@jocala.com so your problem can be fixed!
</b><p>


<b><u>ADB Server</u></b><br>
The "Start" button starts the adb server<br>
The "Stop" button stops the adb server
<p>

<b><u>Push/Pull</u></b><p>
<b>NOTE: Before pushing/pulling data, XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time on the Android device. XBMC sets up its inner directory structure when first run.</b><p>

To push files to XBMC select the destination folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Push". Next, choose and confirm the file to push from your PC to XBMC. The source folder is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.
<p>
To pull files from XBMC select the source folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Pull". Enter a filename into the text area to pull from XBMC to your home folder on the PC.
<p>





<b><u>Application processes</u></b><br>
The <b>"Install APK" </b> button installs or "sideloads"  apps. Click it and choose the APK file you want installed. All installs are done with the "-r" flag. <p>
This has the effect of preserving a previously installed app's data. It has no effect when installing a new app. If you require a "clean" install of an existing app, uninstall it first.
<p>
The apk folder is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.
<p>
The  <b>"Uninstall APK"</b> button uninstalls apps from yout Android device. Enter the package name (e.g. org.xbmc.xbmc) to be uninstalled. To retain application data tick the "-k" checkbox. Data retention has only been tested with XBMC.
<p>
The <b>"Backup XBMC"</b> button backs up the org.xbmc.xbmc folder on the Fire TV. Please note that XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Empty directories are not backed up.
<p>

The <b>"Restore XBMC"</b> button restores a backed up copy of org.xbmc.xbmc to the the Fire TV.
<p>
The <b>"Push Remote"</b> button installs an xml file defining a remote for XBMC.<p> The remote xml files are located in a folder named "xml" in the <b><u>adbFire</b></u> installation folder, Three xml files for the Fire TV remote are included with <b><u>adbFire</b></u> (source: XBMC Wiki). Any xml file installed with this function is installled to userdata/keymaps/keyboard.xml. Please note that XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function.
<p>
The <b>"ADB Shell"</b> button opens a console (Terminal.app for OS X or cmd.exe for Windows) and runs adb shell against the connected device.<p>NOTE: Currently, under OS X, shell will fail if more than one device is detected by adb. e.g. adb devices reveals a phone AND a Fire TV. <p>
<p>
The <b>"Root Fire TV"</b> button installs Chainfire Superuser and GeoHot's towelroot v 1.0. You must complete the process by going to FireTV settings and running the towelroot app. As of this writing, FireOS 51.1.0.2 and below are rootable.<p>

<b><u>Preferences</b></u><br><p>
<b><u>Package name</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.xbmc.<p>
If you are running a fork of XBMC, enter its packagename here, e.g. for Beyond XBMC enter "com.flumpster.xbmc".
<p>Two forks have been tested, Beyond XBMC and elmerohueso's XBMC for Fire TV (which currently keeps org.xbmc.xbmc as a package name.)<p>
NOTE: Forks should work if their file directory structure adheres to XBMC 13.x (files/.xbmc) directory structure. YMMV.<p>



The <b><u>adbFire</b></u> binary and its external files are located in adbFire's installation folder. The default folder is adbFire. <p>
Under OS X, the folder adbFire must be located in the standard location Applications.  Don't move the folder from Applications, the program will fail.<p>
<p>
The adb binaries and dlls are part of the Android SDK.

adbFire is released under the GPL V3. Source is available at http://github.com/jocala/adbFire
