<u><b>adbFire v1.01</b></u> is a companion program for Android XBMC and its forks. It also has many special features for the Amazon Fire TV. <p>adbFire allows you to
install (sideload) XBMC and other apps to your Android device without the bother of installing the Android SDK. <p>

Additionally, it allows you to copy files to and from XBMC, backup and restore XBMC's data, root the Amazon Fire TV (51.1.1.0 or earlier) and much more. <p>
Although originally intended as a Amazon Fire TV adjunct, <b><u>adbFire</u></b> has been successfully tested on Samsung cell phones and tablets.<p>

At startup  "ADB running" is displayed the status bar. If it's not, click "Start" in the ADB server group.
<p>
Enter the Android device IP or name into the text box (e.g. 192.168.1.110, or mydevice, if you have assigned your device a name). This address is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.<p>
<p>
Click "Connect". You should see "Device connected" on the status bar. If you don't, double-check your entry in the text box. When you establish a successful connection, <b><u>adbFire</b></u> will remember it for your next session.

<p><b>If you're unable
 to start the ADB server and connect to your Android device, this program will be non-functional. Please contact the author, jocala@jocala.com so your problem can be fixed!
</b><p>


<b><u>ADB Server</u></b><br>
The "Start" button starts the adb server<br>
The "Stop" button stops the adb server
<p>

<b><u>Push/Pull/Delete</u></b><p>
<b>NOTE: Before pushing/pulling/deleting data in XBMC folders, XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time on the Android device. XBMC sets up its inner directory structure when first run. The folder /sdcard/ is available anytime.</b><p>
<p>
"Push" and "Pull" are simply Android's terminology for file copying. From your PC you "push" files to your Android device or conversely, you "pull" files from your Android device to your PC.<p>
To push files select the destination folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Push". Next, choose and confirm the file to push from  PC to device. The source folder is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.
<p>
To pull files select the source folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Pull". Enter a filename into the text area to be pulled from the device to the PC's "pull folder" (default: home folder). You can change the destination folder for pulled files in the preferences dialog.
<p>
To delete files select the source folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Delete". Enter a filename you wish deleted into the text area.
<p>

<u><b>"USB Drive" </b> </u>
This will mounts/unmounts a USB drive or stick at /dev/block/sda1. Currently, it can only deal with one external storage device. <p> If you have multiple devices (e.g. /dev/block/sda1, /dev/block/sdb1, etc) you may be better served with a solution like Chainfire's stickmount.<p> If checked, the "persistence" checkbox mounts<br> /dev/block/sda1 at boot.
<p>
Mounting USB mass storage devices requires installation of busybox.
<p>
<u><b>"SSH" </b> </u>
This starts/stops the dropbear SSH daemon.  If checked, the "persistence" checkbox starts dropbear at boot. Dropbear requires pre-installation of busybox.
<p>
<b><u>System processes</u></b><br>
The <b>"Install APK" </b> button installs or "sideloads"  apps. Click it and choose the APK file you want installed. All installs are done with the "-r" flag. <p>
This has the effect of preserving a previously installed app's data. It has no effect when installing a new app. If you require a "clean" install of an existing app, uninstall it first.
<p>
The apk folder is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.
<p>
The  <b>"Uninstall APK"</b> button uninstalls apps from yout Android device. Enter the package name (e.g. org.xbmc.xbmc) to be uninstalled. To retain application data tick the "-k" checkbox. Data retention has only been tested with XBMC.
<p>
The <b>"Backup XBMC"</b> button backs up the org.xbmc.xbmc folder on the Fire TV. Please note that XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Empty directories are not backed up.
<p>

The <b>"Restore XBMC"</b> button restores a backed up copy of org.xbmc.xbmc to the the Fire TV.
<p>
The <b>"Push Remote"</b> button installs an xml file defining a remote for XBMC.<p> The remote xml files are located in a folder named "xml" in the <b><u>adbFire</b></u> installation folder, Three xml files for the Fire TV remote are included with <b><u>adbFire</b></u> (source: XBMC Wiki). Any xml file installed with this function is installled to userdata/keymaps/keyboard.xml. Please note that XBMC <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function.
<p>
The <b>"Screen shot"</b> button takes a snapshot of the device's current screen, names it screen.png, and saves it to the pulled files folder (default: home directory).<p> Unfortunately, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) prevents you from taking screenshots of most commercia video streams. Luckily, XBMC is not affected by HDCP.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Filesystem R/W</b></u> Makes /system partition writable.
<p>
<b><u>Filesystem R/O</b></u> Makes /system partition read-only.
<p>

The <b>"Root Fire TV"</b> button installs Chainfire Superuser and GeoHot's towelroot v 3.0. You must complete the process by going to FireTV settings and running the towelroot app. As of this writing, FireOS 51.1.0.2 and below are rootable.<p>
<p>
The <b>"ADB Shell"</b> button opens a console (Terminal.app for OS X or cmd.exe for Windows) and runs adb shell against the connected device.<p>NOTE: Currently, under OS X, shell will fail if more than one device is detected by adb. e.g. adb devices reveals a phone AND a Fire TV. <p>
<p>
<u><b>Menu items</b></u>
<p>
<u><b>About</b></u> Version information and home URL.
<p>
<b><u>Reboot device</b></u> Reboots the connected device.
<p>
<b><u>Reboot into recovery</b></u> Reboots the connected device into recovery.
<p>
<b><u>Help</b></u> Opens this window.

<b><u>Quit adbFire</b></u>  Terminates adbFire.

<b><u>Root only menu options</b></u>
<p>
<b><u>Install Busybox</b></u><br>
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find on a Linux system. It has an extremely small footprint, under 2Mb
<p>
<b><u>Uninstall Busybox</b></u><br>
Removes BusyBox frpm your system.<p>

<b><u>Install SSH</b></u><br>
Installs SSH/SFTP to your device. SSH is used to open a terminal session between your PC and your android device. SFTP opens an ftp-like connection. This utility has a footprint under 1Mb.
<p>
Dropbear requires pre-installation of busybox.
<p>
<b><u>Uninstall SSH</b></u><br>
Removes SSH/SFTP from your device.<p>

<b><u>SSH password</b></u><br>
Change default SSH/SFTP password from 'password' to your choice.<p>

<b><u>Install Fire TV firmware</b></u><br>
Install firmware to Amazon Fire TV. Upgrade (or downgrade) your AFTV firmware. This works for firmware on a mounted USB drive/stick and for firmware on your PC.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Preferences</b></u>
<p>
<b><u>XBMC Package name</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.xbmc. This varies depending on what variant of XBMC you're running.<p>
If you are running a fork of XBMC, enter its packagename here, e.g. for Beyond XBMC enter "com.flumpster.xbmc".
<p>Thus far, SPMC, BeyondXBMC, elmerohueso's XBMC Launcher, Gotham 13.1 and Helix nightlies have been tested with adbFire.<p>
In theory any fork should work if its file directory structure adheres to XBMC's (/sdcard/Android/data/packagename/files/.xbmc) directory structure. YMMV.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Pull Folder</b></u>, default: User's home directory.<br>
Choose the folder where pulled XBMC files and screenshot pngs are placed.
<p>
<b><u>Fire TV updates</b></u> Toggle Amazon Fire TV updates on/off. This disables/enables com.amazon.dcp.
<p>

=============================
<p>
The <b><u>adbFire</b></u> binary and its external files are located in adbFire's installation folder. The default folder is adbFire. <p>
Under OS X, the folder adbFire must be located in the standard location Applications.  Don't move the folder from Applications, the program will fail.<p>
<p>
The adb binaries and dlls are part of the Android SDK.
