<u><b>"USB Drives/Samba" </b> </u>
The Mount/Unmount buttons mount/unmount all connected USB drives or sticks. If checked, the "Mount drives at boot" checkbox in <a href="preferences.html">Device Setup</a> mounts your devices at boot.
<p>
Mounting USB mass storage devices requires installation of busybox. <p>
Mounted drives (and /sdcard) are exported to the network via Samba, a
form of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol. 
<p>
The Samba server you should
see on your network is called adbFire. The storage is exported as sdcard
and usb. Usb is a folder containing all your /dev/block/sd* devices. They
ar mounted as drive1,drive2,drive3, etc in the order in which they are 
processed.
<p>
It's an unfortunate reality that assigning mount points by device name
(/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1) is unreliable. Now we have the ability to mount
a drive to a specific location by its label or UUID, the unique id that
is assigned when a device is formatted. 
<p>
This release of adbFire has a script, /system/xbin/mntdrives2.sh, that you
must edit to assign UUIDs or labels  to specific mount points (e.g. /storage/usb/movies),
but future releases will have functions that automate this process, making it
point-and-click. If you're interested, read the script and post any questions you may have.  
<p>

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
