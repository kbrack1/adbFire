The <b>"Splash Screen"</b> button installs a png splash screen file to the "media" folder under .xbmc. A Kodi splash screen and Elmerhuso's Gotham splash screen are included.<p> You may also drop your own png files into the adbfiles/splash folder (For OS X, the adbfiles folder is inside the adbFire.app bundle. Right click on this file to browse its contents). Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
