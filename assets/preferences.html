<b><u>The Device Setup Dialog</b></u>
<p>

<b><u>Description</b></u><br>
Enter a descriptive title for your device.
<p>
<b><u>Device IP</b></u><br>
Enter the device IP address. A device name is also allowable
if you have set it up with your router.
<p>
<b><u>Package name</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.kodi. <br>
This varies depending on what variant of XBMC/Kodi you're running.<p>
If you are running a fork of XBMC/Kodi, enter its package name here, e.g. for SPMC enter "com.semperpax.spmc".
<p>
If you are running Kodi leave this setting unchanged.
<p>

<b><u>File Path</b></u>, default: files/.kodi <br>
This may also vary depending on what variant of XBMC/Kodi you're running.<p>
The File Path for XBMC is files/.xbmc -- the File Path for SPMC is files/.spmc
<p>
The period "." that you see at the beginning of "files" is very important. Don't leave it off!
<p>
The File Path is not set up on your Fire Device until Kodi has completed its initial run. adbFire uses the File Path in conjunction with the Package Name to locate the Media Center on your device. If either are entered incorrectly, none of the "Kodi" functions will work.
<p>
If you are running Kodi leave this setting unchanged.
<p>
<b><u>Pull Folder</b></u>, default: User's home directory.<br>
Choose the folder where pulled Kodi files and screenshot pngs are placed.
<p>
<b><u>AFTV updates</b></u> Toggle AFTV updates on/off. This disables/enables com.amazon.dcp. Default is updates on. Changing this option requires root.
<p>
<b><u>SSH server at boot</b></u> When checked this option has the SSH server start at boot. This option requires root.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates at startup</b> checkbox causes adbFire to check jocala.com for updates at startup. This is on by default.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates</b> button contacts jocala.com for an immediate update check. If an update is available adbFire offers to connect for download.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
