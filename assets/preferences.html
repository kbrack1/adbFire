<b><u>The Preferences Dialog</b></u>
<p>
<b><u>Package name</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.xbmc. This varies depending on what variant of XBMC/Kodi you're running.<p>
If you are running a fork of XBMC/Kodi, enter its package name here, e.g. for SPMC enter "com.semperpax.spmc".
<p>
If you are running the Kodi beta, enter "org.xbmc.kodi". This will be the default when Kodi is offically released.<p>
<p>Thus far, SPMC, BeyondXBMC, elmerohueso's XBMC Launcher and Kodi nightlies have been tested with adbFire.<p>
In theory any fork should work if its file directory structure adheres to Kodi/XBMC conventions (/sdcard/Android/data/packagename/files/.xbmc/.kodi) directory structure. YMMV.<p>
<p>
As of this writing to use the Kodi enter org.xbmc.kodi into the Kodi package name field.
<p>
<b><u>Pull Folder</b></u>, default: User's home directory.<br>
Choose the folder where pulled Kodi files and screenshot pngs are placed.
<p>
<b><u>AFTV updates</b></u> Toggle AFTV updates on/off. This disables/enables com.amazon.dcp. Default is updates on. Changing this option requires root.
<p>
<b><u>SSH server at boot</b></u> When checked this option has the SSH server start at boot. This option requires root.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates at startup</b> checkbox causes adbFire to check jocala.com for updates at startup. This is on by default.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates</b> button contacts jocala.com for an immediate update check. If an update is available adbFire offers to connect for download.
<p>
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
