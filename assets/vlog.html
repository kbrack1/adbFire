<b><u>View Log</b></u> adbFire keeps two logs, one log of your current run and a log of your previous run. They are named adbfire.log and adbfire.old.log.<p> Using the "View Log" menu option, you can view both these logs and copy them to your clipboard for inclusion in a support post or email. <p> When the Viewer opens it shows by default your current running log, adbfire.log. Pressing the "Swap" toggles over to adbfire.old.log. Pressing "Swap" again toggles back. <p>Thus you can toggle back and forth between adbfire.log and adbfire.log.old
<p>

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
