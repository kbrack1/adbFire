The <b>"Push Remote"</b> button installs an xml file defining a remote for Kodi.<p> The remote xml files are located in a folder named "xml" in the <b><u>adbfiles</b></u> folder. (For OS X, the adbfiles folder is inside the adbFire.app bundle. Right click on this file to browse its contents.) Three xml files for the AFTV remote are included with <b><u>adbFire</b></u> (source: Kodi Wiki). Any xml file installed with this function is installled to userdata/keymaps/keyboard.xml. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
