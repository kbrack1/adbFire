The <b>"Screen shot"</b> button takes a snapshot of the device's current screen, gives it a date/time based name, and saves it to the pulled files folder (default: home directory).<p> Unfortunately, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) prevents you from taking screenshots of most commercia video streams. Luckily, Kodi is not affected by HDCP.<p>
