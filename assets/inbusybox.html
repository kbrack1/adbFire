<b><u>Install Busybox</b></u><br>
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find on a Linux system. It has an extremely small footprint, under 2Mb
<p>
The included version of Busybox is specially compiled for adbFire. It includes options not typically found in Play Store BusyBoxes.

<b>Root is REQUIRED</b>
