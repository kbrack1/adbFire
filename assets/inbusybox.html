<b><u>Install System Tools</b></u><br>
adbFire depends on several different utilities to do its job and they are all included; there's nothing else to download.<p>
First, adbFire includes its own version of busybox that is specially compiled and includes options not typically found in Play Store BusyBoxes. <p>
Busybox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable, providing replacements for most of the utilities you usually find on a Linux system. It has an extremely small footprint, under 2Mb
<p>

<p>
Other tools installed include rbox's unlocker, samba and USB drive mounting scripts. Many adbFire functions require these tools, so it's highly suggested you install them.<p> Please note that standalone versions of these tools installed from the Play Store are <b><u>NOT</b></u> supported and will usually cause adbFire to malfunction. Please uninstall Play Store versions of busybox and samba before installing adbFire System Tools.
<p>
<b>Root is REQUIRED</b>
