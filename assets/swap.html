<b><u>Swap /data</u></b><br>
This option allows you to use external storage as your /data partition. This technique was originally ported to the
 Fire TV by jmandawg@xda, but was restricted to /dev/sda1, and no other devices could be attached.<p>
adbFire's enhanced busybox adds the ability to mount drives by UUID, allowing you to mount any individual
drive wherever you want, so now you can designate a /data drive and have as many other drives as you please
attached for movies, music. animae or whatever. 
<p>
First, adding a data drive is not particularly dangerous, but it's really a good idea to have ClockWork Mod
Recovery installed. Since the Fire TV has a locked boot-loader and is currently unrootable, you should protect yourself.
<p>
You will need an powered external drive, a USB stick or Flash card attached of sufficient capacity to make this worth your while.
It will need to be partitioned and formatted as EXT4. Windows users, you can use a http://www.sysresccd.org Linux Rescue Disk or download http://www.partitionwizard.com's Partition Wizard</a>
for free to prepare your storage device. 
<p>
OS X users, if you don't have access to Fusion or Parallels for a Linux partition, Paragon has  
http://www.paragon-software.com has ExtFS for Mac, it's not free ($19.99) but does offer a 10 day fully working demo. And the Linux Rescue Disk
is an option for most Macs as well.
<p>
Get your drive partitioned and plugged in. Most hard drives require a powered USB hub. Sticks and cards usually don't. Don't mount the external device yet. Once the device is plugged in, select <b><u>Swap /data</b></u> from
 the <b><u>Root menu</b></u>
<p>
A Drive selection dialog will pop up showing the external EXT4 USB devices attached to the Fire TV. Double-click your drive or click and press "Ok".
Next, a dialog similar to this will appear:
<p>
---<br>
Drive UUID="c67de5e7-481e-f8eb-4c4d-e7c390848468" selected.
<p>
Proceed with /data swap prep for this drive? This may be a lengthy process, depending<br>
on the amount of material on your Fire TV /data partition. <p>
A popup message will appear when prep is finished<p>
Yes/No
<br>---
<p>
Select Ok to proceed or Cancel to cancel the operation. As the dialog says, when you proceed it may be a lengthy
process; it's copying up to almost 5Gb from the /data partition to the external device. It's not unusual for
the length of time to max out the progress indicator. In testing, a 1Gb data partition takes almost 10 minutes
to complete.

<p>
Once complete a popup will appear notifying you of the prep operation's success and offering to reboot. At this point your new /data partition is ready.
