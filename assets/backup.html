The <b>"Backup Kodi"</b> button backs up the contents of the .kodi folder on the device. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Empty directories are not backed up.
If you are running something other than <a href=kodi.html>Kodi</a> you will need to change the package name amd File Path
in the <a href=preferences.html>Device Setup</a> dialog to whatever package name and File Path your software uses.
<p>
If you have <a href="mvdata.html">moved data or thumbnails</a> to extUsb, the backup still proceeds normally. However in the case of thumbnails, they are saved in the default userdata folder of the backup and the advancedsettings.xml file is renamed advancedsettings,backup. <p>
Currently, when restoring backup sets nothing is moved to extUsb. If desired you will need to  <a href="mvdata.html">redo</a> the move via adbFire. A future release is planned that will perform data/thumbnail moves as part of the restore.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
