The <b>"Backup Kodi"</b> button backs up the org.xbmc.kodi folder on the device. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Empty directories are not backed up.
If you are running something other than <a href=kodi.html>Kodi</a> you will need to change the package name
in the <a href=preferences.html>Preferences</a> dialog to whatever package name your software uses..
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
