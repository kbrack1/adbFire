<b><u>Push/Pull/Delete</u></b><p>
<b>NOTE: Before pushing/pulling/deleting data in Kodi folders, Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time on the Android device. Kodi sets up its inner directory structure when first run. The folder /sdcard/ is available anytime.</b><p>
<p>
"Push" and "Pull" are simply Android's terminology for file copying. From your PC you "push" files to your Android device or conversely, you "pull" files from your Android device to your PC.<p>
To push files select the destination folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Push". Next, choose and confirm the file to push from  PC to device. The source folder is "sticky", it will be remembered for future runs.
<p>
To pull files select the source folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Pull". You will be presented with a browsable list of files. Select the file you wish to pull and double-click or press "Ok". It will be copied to the PC's "pull folder" (default: home folder). You can change the destination folder for pulled files in the preferences dialog.
<p>
To delete files select the source folder from the dropdown widget, then press "Delete". You will be presented with a browsable list of files. Select the file you wish to delete and double-click or press "Ok".
