<b><u>USB Mode</b></u><br>
The USB Mode checkbox allows adbFire to perform all non-root functions via a
USB connection to the Fire TV Stick. It does not work with the standard Fire TV.<p>
The connect and disconnect buttons are disabled when the USB Mode box is checked. A
USB connection is obtained when the ADB server detects the Stick connected via USB.
<p>
Sometimes, getting a connection is tricky. You may have to stop/start the ADB server
several times or unplug/plug in the Stick before a connection locks in.
<p>
Once a connection is "live" you will be able to open an ADB Shell to the Stick or open a
console and issue the command "adb devices" and see the Stick listed.
<p>
In order to connect Windows to the Stick via USB, Google's WinUSB device driver must be
installed. This driver is included with adbFire in the "winusb" folder. Directions for
installation can be seen at jocala.com; the link is below this help doc.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbFire produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
