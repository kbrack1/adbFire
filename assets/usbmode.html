<b><u>USB Mode</b></u><br>

adbFire features USB Mode to manage Kodi. USB Mode is available for all devices.
<p>
To use USB Mode with the Stick, connect your Fire TV Stick to your PC via USB Cable.
<p>
To use USB Mode on the Fire TV, under the Fire TV's Settings-System->Developer Options, enable USB Debugging and connect your Fire TV to your PC via USB Cable. This will disable USB Storage.
<p>
Click the USB Mode checkbox to connect; you may have to click the checkbox a few times. Once connected a popup dialog will ask you to choose tour media center software. Once selected, all the Kodi functions will be available.
<p>
In rare cases you may need to use adbFire's <a href="console.html">Console</a>  to establish a USB connection. If so, once you are connected and not before, click the USB via console checkbox. A popup dialog will ask you to choose tour media center software. Once selected, all the Kodi functions will be available.
<p>

Please note: Currently only one device at a time can be connected via USB or IP.
