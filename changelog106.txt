adbFire 1.06 changelog
=======================

The Windows adbFire folder can now be installed
wherever you wish.  It has been tested under Windows 7
and XP. Shortcuts to adbFire.exe  work as expected. 

The adbFire folder is  where all files needed by adbFire.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files,
in addition to the adbFire.exe program. 

Samba networking has been added. Click  "Mount" and after your
usb storage mounts, it's exported via samba. Your /sdcard folder
is exported as well. The server name is adbfire and the exports 
are /usb and /sdcard. Samba is persistent between boots if you 
check mounting to be persistent. 

In testing the adbfire server and exported folders /sdcard and /usb
are visible to Windows XP and 7, OS X Mavericks and Linux Mint. Drag
and drop and other file management work as expected between the FireTV
and clients on the network.
