adbFire 1.05 changelog
=======================

Both the Windows version and the OS X version can now be installed
wherever you wish.  

The Windows version of adbFire unzips to a folder, also named 
adbFire. Within that folder is the binary, adbFire.exe and a folder,
adbfiles. The adbfiles folder is  where all files needed by adbFire.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files. 
you can move the adbFire folder anywhere on your hard drive.

The OS X version of adbFire, adbFire.app is usually installed to
the /Application folder on your Mac. However you can move it
wherever you like.

adbFire now includes Llama, with permission from the developer at
KebabApps.com. This allows:

1. Boot AFTV directly to XBMC

2. Connect XBMC to the Classic TV app. This allows starting XBMC from
AFTV's upper level menus.

3. Both of the above.

The option to change the Classic TV icon to a XBMC icon is included.
This can also be reversed, restoring the Default Classic TV icon.


The Preferences dialog has changed. If you open the 
preferences dialog then exit without changes,  the
"updates disabled/enabled" pop-up dialog is suppressed.  

adbFire can now check for updates when it starts, and open
the adbFire page to download the new version if desired.
This option is on by default, but can be turned off in
Preferences.

Preferences also has a "Check for updates" button. 

A dedicated button to change the XBMC splash screen has been added.
This was previously possible using the "adb push" button, selecting the
destination folder "media", but there have been requests for a 
dedicated button. Elmerhuso's XBMC splash.png is included, of
course you can add your own.  

Clickable URL links are now included. Links include adbFire's home
page, jocala.com/adbfire.html, the XBMC wiki, and links to the forum
topics where adbFire is supported, xda and xbmc. 

version number changed to constant. 

Help expanded.
