adbFire 1.06 changelog
=======================

The Windows adbFire folder can now be installed
wherever you wish.  It has been tested under Windows 7
and XP. Shortcuts to adbFire.exe  work as expected. 

The adbFire folder is  where all files needed by adbFire.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files,
in addition to the adbFire.exe program. 

Samba networking has been added. Click  "Mount" and after your
usb storage mounts, it's exported via samba. Your /sdcard folder
is exported as well. The server name is adbfire and the exports 
are /usb and /sdcard. Samba is persistent between boots if you 
check mounting to be persistent. 

In testing the adbfire server and exported folders /sdcard and /usb
are visible to Windows XP and 7, OS X Mavericks and Linux Mint. Drag
and drop and other file management work as expected between the FireTV
and clients on the network. 

Credits and links provided for all helper programs.

adbFire 1.05 changelog
=======================

Both the Windows version and the OS X version can now be installed
wherever you wish.  

The Windows version of adbFire ships with a folder, named 
adbfiles. You can install the adbFire.exe program wherever
you wish, as long as the adbfiles folder is installed there also.

The adbfiles folder is  where all files needed by adbFire.exe
kept. This folder holds adb.exe, scripts and various other files. 

The OS X version of adbFire, adbFire.app is usually installed to
the /Application folder on your Mac. However you can move it
wherever you like. The Mac version of adbFire also has an adbfiles
folder, but it's inside the adbFire.app bundle.

adbFire now includes Llama, with permission from the developer at
KebabApps.com. Llama allows us to:

1. Boot AFTV directly to XBMC

2. Connect XBMC to the Classic TV app. This allows starting XBMC from
AFTV's upper level menus.

3. Both of the above.

The option to change the Classic TV icon to an XBMC or Kodi icon is
included. This can also be reversed, restoring the Default Classic TV icon.


The Preferences dialog has changed. If you open the 
preferences dialog then exit without changes,  the
"updates disabled/enabled" pop-up dialog is suppressed.  

adbFire can now check for updates when it starts, and open
the adbFire page to download the new version if desired.
This option is on by default, but can be turned off in
Preferences.

Preferences also has a "Check for updates" button. 

A dedicated button to change the XBMC splash screen has been added.
This was previously possible using the "adb push" button, selecting the
destination folder "media", but there have been requests for a 
dedicated button. Elmerhuso's XBMC splash screen and a Kodi splash
screen are included, and of course you can add your own. Drop them
into the "splash" folder.  

Clickable URL links are now included. Links include adbFire's home
page, jocala.com/adbfire.html, the XBMC wiki, and links to the forum
topics where adbFire is supported, xda and xbmc. 

version number changed to constant. 

Help expanded.
